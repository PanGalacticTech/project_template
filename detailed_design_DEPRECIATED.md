# [3]Detailed Design Document - [Project Title]

_This form is intended to assist in documenting the detailed design, throughout the design process. This document is likely to vary more than others, as the steps taken during 
development may affect the way the development team wish to document their processes._

*During design process, refer back to forms [[1]HL_requirements_capture.md](https://github.com/PanGalacticTech/project_template/blob/main/%5B1%5DHL_requirements_capture.md).
and [[2]LL_requirements_capture.md](https://github.com/PanGalacticTech/project_template/blob/main/%5B2%5DLL_requirements_capture.md) to guide and reference how the requirements
affect the design decisions made.* <br>

## [3.1]Hardware Specification

_This section documents as much of the hardware design required to meet requirements as possible_

Common sections might include:
- Circuit Design & Schematic
- Electronic Components Identification
- PCB Design Layout
- PCB Design Validation?
- PCB Fabrication notes

### Example Hardware Specification - [USB Saver Tool]

#### [3.1.1] Circuit Design
*Insert Schematic Here*

#### [3.1.2] Components Specification
*Insert Table of Selected Components*

#### [3.1.3] PCB Design
*Insert PCB Design, 3D model*
*Identify potential issues with design*
***Verification & Validation Step Required Here ... Must be validated against HL requirements document***

#### [3.1.4] PCB Fabrication

*Prototype PCB will be fabricated in house to avoid shipping fees*

*Insert link to finished fabrication files folder*?

## [2.2]Software Specification

*This section will document software approaches to task solving, document software elements chosen, languages chosen, development environments to be utelised. <br>
Software frameworks that will be utelised can be documented, as well as outlining specific methods & functions that will be required to meet the requirements captured
in requirements documents*

Common sections might include:
- Programming Languages used
- Software Elements (Libraries identified, external software interfaces, etc)
- Development Environments, (IDE etc)
- Software Frameworks (OOP, Classes, Class Inheretence, etc)
- Specific Functions & Methods that will be required 

## [2.3]Example Software Specification - [USB Saver Tool]

 ***No Software requirements identified for this project***
