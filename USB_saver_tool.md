# Notes for USB Saver Tool


Started these notes as an example, may wish to go back




### Example Project Brief - [USB Saver Tool]

> The client requires a PCB to protect laptops and personal devices from damage
> while programming or powering USB enabled embedded systems projects during
> development & prototyping.




## [1.3]Example Requirements Capture - [USB Saver Tool]


> HL.1. Device must protect Client USB from direct short between VCC & GND pins                                            <br>
> HL.2. Device must protect Client USB from current draw >0.5A, as common for older devices.                               <br>
> HL.3. Device must protect Client USB from voltages >5v applied to VCC and Data Pins.                                     <br>
> HL.4. Device should prevent voltages >1v being applied to the client USB GND pin.                                        <br>
> HL.5. Device should operate with <0.2A quiessent current, in order to maximise power available from client USB for embedded project.   <br>
