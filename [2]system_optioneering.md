# [2]  System Optioneering - [Project Title]

_This form is intended to assist in optioneering to derive low level hardware & software specification from the ***Validated***  
High Level Requirements Capture Form [[1]requirements_capture.md](https://github.com/PanGalacticTech/project_template/blob/main/%5B1%5Drequirements_capture.md).
Its scope can be adapted to suit projects of varying complexity_ <br> 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## [2.1] Design Tradeoffs & Optioneering
_Space to work through different options before deciding on specific low level requirements & system specification for hardware & software.
It is useful to highlight situations where one design decision is dependent on other decisions, or where a design decision will have known, or forseeable impacts on
other decisions later._

### Preamble
_Introduction to the design approach if required_ <br>

### Optioneering Diagrams
_Flowcharts can be used to explore the relationships between different options, and display graphically how making specific design decisions
will affect the other available options._

### Circuit Design Optioneering
_Exploration of circuit elements that might be used to meet design objectives_


#### Overvoltage Protection of 5v USB Bus ***[HL.13]***
_The aim of overvoltage protection for the 5v bus, is to protect the raspberry pis in the event +12v power is accidently applied to this bus, pulling all the outputs to 12v
and causing damage. Several possible approaches will be discussed below_

##### Approach 1 - Zener Diode

>    5.1v zener diode reverse biased between the USB outputs 5v rail, and GND.
>    A 100ohm resistor must be between the potential source of over voltage and the zener diode.[^zener]

***Problems with this approach***

>    If the source of the overvoltage is also on the USB bus, this does not nessissarily solve the problem,
>    as the current will flow unimpeded through the zener diode, causing overheating and component failure. 
>    If it fails open circuit (likely) then the protection is no longer active and the 5v bus will be pulled to 12v.

> As the likely source of the overvoltage would be the other USB inputs, each V+ rail would need a 100ohm resistor, with a zener diode on the supply side of the resistor.

##### Approach 2 - Using the MOSFET That is Already There

>    As the USB channel is already designed to be switched off via a logic high signal (+5v) from a microcontroller, 
>    could that same MOSTFET also be triggered with logic high if a fault condition is detected?
>    This solution would have to be passive, i.e not be reliant on the MCU to trigger, as this
>    would delay response and would not stop damage from occuring.
>     <br>
>     A logical OR gate could be used to provide a buffer between the logic HIGH/LOW pin on the microcontroller, and the
>     other system for providing a logical HIGH in the case the 5v bus moves out of tolerance. 1 logical OR gate would be required for each USB output,
>     The output of each logic gate, feeds the gate of each MOSFET

***OverVoltage Detection***

> Voltage Supivisor/detection ICs: <br>
> [TL431 Voltage Reference, Adjustable Shunt](https://uk.farnell.com/on-semiconductor/tl431acdg/voltage-ref-shunt-2-495v-36v-soic/dp/1651199)<br>
>  Voltage is monitored on 5v rail, and IC outputs a logic high if voltage goes outside of set nominal band. <br>
>  
> **Use Case**
> [TI TL431 for Under & Overvoltage Detection]( https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva987a/slva987a.pdf?ts=1642107195143&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)[^uvov]
> In this case, the V(high) and V(low) thresholds are set via 4 resistors. Calculations outlined below[^tl431] NOTE: Output from LT431 is INVERTED. NOT gate required on
> output for correction.

Resistor Values Estimated:
> R1: 470k      <br>
> R2: 560k      <br>
> Vhigh ~ 5.5v   <br>
> <br>
> R3: 560k   <br>
> R4: 470k   <br>
> Vlow ~ 4.6v


***Implementing This Solution***
> Requires: <br>
> 5 * OR Gates <br>
> 1 * NOT Gate <br>
> <br>
> To make these gates from common gates, it would require: <br>
> 16 * NAND Gates. (3 req for OR gate, 1 for NOT gate) <br>
> OR <br>
> 11 * NOR Gates. (2 req for OR gate, 1 for NOT gate) <br>
> Suggest: <br> 
> 3 * [MC74HC02ADG SMD Quad Input NOR Gate](https://uk.farnell.com/on-semiconductor/mc74hc02adg/ic-74hc-cmos-smd-74hc02-soic14/dp/9666893)

#### Power Bus Visual Fault Indications ***[HL.14]***
_The aim of this requirement is to provide additional information to engineers testing, maintaining and debugging the system. For this
reason it should be independent of all other systems, and simplified as much as possible._

>   I much prefer the idea of independent indication for each bus, rather than a traffic light with 
>   "All Nominal" "Something Off Nominal" "Everything Off Nominal" indication, as I believe this is; <br>
>   1: less useful than say "A Okay" "B Okay" "C Okay" indications and <br>
>   2: it may also be harder to design if we take a passive approach, i.e: This system should work independently
>   of any microcontrollers.

##### Option 1

>   A window comparator circuit[^comp] could be used to display whether each bus is falling within a predefined "nominal" window,
>   however this circuit would be reliant on stable Vcc, so is not useful for detecting if Vcc is off nominal.
>   An independent linear or LDO regulator could provide independent reference voltages to solve this problem, but 
>   increase in cost & complexity.



##### Option 2

> Led VU Meter, Options detailed [^vu]  [LM3916 Dot/Bar Display Driver](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General%20IC/lm3916.pdf) Monitors 
> analog voltage level and lights up to 10 LEDs sequentially
> Supply Voltage from 3v to 25v - Suggest it runs from 12v rail for each use case. Input can handle from 0 to 35v 

 
> "The LM3916 is extremely easy to apply. A 1.2V fullscale meter requires only one resistor in addition to
> the ten LEDs. One more resistor programs the fullscale anywhere from 1.2V to 12V independent of
> supply voltage. LED brightness is easily controlled
> with a single pot."

> This IC could be set such that a single mid range output lights a green LED, the bottom half of the range lights a yellow LED, and the top half of the range lights a RED led, 
> which would provide under and over voltage indication for each voltage bus.
> Voltage divider would be required for detection of 24v bus.

#### MCU Selection

The best options for MCU seem to be either;
[AtMega328p](https://uk.farnell.com/microchip/atmega328p-an/mcu-8bit-atmega-20mhz-tqfp-32/dp/2443178?st=ATmega328P) combined with CH340 for USB comms & programming, ISP header for programming bootloaders, and an WiFi transcever as a peripheral device, or <br>
[ESP32-WROOM-32U](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Espressif-Systems/ESP32-WROOM-32UM113DH3200UH3Q0?qs=W%2FMpXkg%252BdQ4Fqx%2FReRQpFQ==&mgh=1&vip=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAxJSPBhAoEiwAeO_fPwE6kImUAnBTI5SyodKJNS7nNKTfdQ13Md3OplGP5AphD8abym4PYBoCbGkQAvD_BwE), with the same USB interface and ISP header, but without the need for an additional WiFi transcever. The ESP has a number of disadvantages for use 
as the MCU in this use case, as precise ADC is required for current and voltage monitoring.

However the selection of the peripheral WiFi adaptor throws up an ironic aside, it seems much cheaper to use ESP32
as a WiFi device than sourcing dedicated wifi transceiver modules like the ublox nina, or. The ESP32 is available with the option to connect an external antenna, which makes the system more adaptable for use
in areas that may not have adiquate WiFi signal with the antenna obscured inside a metal box.

#### Notes
**VGS & Rds Explanation**

_Assuming That_

|Attribute | Value | Max Current Flow
|---|---|---|
| Source Voltage | 5v |
|Rds(on) @ Vgs -4.5v | 0.0133 ohm      | 5/0.0133 = 376A |
|Rds(on) @ Vgs -10v   | 0.0083 ohm      | 5/0.0093 = 537A  |


#### Footnotes

[^Rds]: Drain-to-Source On-Resistance <br>
        - If current required is 2.5A, then R=5/2.5: R=2ohm absolute max Rds during operation (in practice must be much lower)   <br>
        - If Vcc = 5v, and gate is pulled to 0v GND, then Vgs ~-5v                                                                <br>
        - Datasheet shows Rds(on) @ Vgs -4.5 will be ~ 0.0133 ohm                                                                     <br>
        - If Vcc = 12v & Gate is pulled to 0v GND, then Vgs ~ -10v therefore Rds(on) ~ 0.0093 ohm                                                       <br>
        - HOWEVER, controller can only provide 5v so will need drivers to fully turn off MOSFET, see[^Vgs(th)]                              <br>

[^Vgs(th)]: Gate-Source Threshold Voltage <br>
            - Datasheet shows that Vgs must be >-2.0V to turn off device  <br>
            - i.e. Id = -250 uA @ Vds (Maximum Drain - Source voltage differential) <br>
            - Therefore if VCC is 12v, Gate Voltage must be driven to >10v to turn off MOSFET <br>

[^V&V]: Verification & Validation - What is it? <br>
        - Verification - _"Does the implementation meet the requirements?"_ <br>
        - Validation   - _"Are the requirements correct"_
